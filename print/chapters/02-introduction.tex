\begin{subchapter}{Single carrier transmision}
  A classic digital transmission standard will usually map
  digital bits to complex symbols and will modulate these
  symbols at a fixed rate onto a single carrier frequency. \\

  An example of six \acrshort{qam4} symbols that are transmitted
  in equal time intervals can be seen in figure \ref{img:qam4_symbol_time}.
  The Symbols are shown in the complex baseband domain and the
  hypothetical filter is constructed such, that the signal
  phase is interpolated linearily between symbols.
